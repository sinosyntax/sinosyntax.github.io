    <main>      
    <p>Born in San Jose, California, I had the privilege of growing up in a multiethnic 
        learning environment, where I gained invaluable exposure to diverse cultures and values. My early love 
        for music and the humanities blossomed into a deep appreciation for arts education and further shaped my 
        understanding of the world around me.</p>
    <p>These early experiences instilled in me a lifetime commitment to 
        education, which I cultivated as a first-generation college student of <em>East Asian Studies</em>, focusing on
        China. This and other studies in literature and music set the foundation for a twenty-year 
        career exploring various professional roles across Silicon Valley and Asia, including a decade in Shanghai 
        working for architecture and environmental companies in marketing and communications roles.</p>
    <p>Today, I have a great interest in <strong>instructional design</strong> and related areas, as well as a 
        passion for cross-cultural training, adaptive learning, and sustainable design. I am currently enrolled 
        in the Masters of Science program in <em>Learning Technologies and Design</em> at the University of Missouri,
        Columbia, which I expect to complete in December 2024.</p>
