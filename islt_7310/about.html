                    <p>Hello! Feel free to learn a little more about me here.</p>
                    <p>Growing up in the diverse backdrop of California's Bay Area, I had the privilege to connect with many different cultures and values. A budding interest in music and the humanities shaped my worldview early on. Opportunities to travel and perform instilled in me a deep appreciation for the arts and education.

                    <section>
                    <p>These experiences soon led me to become the first of my family to attend college. Guided by interests in world literatures and music, I focused my studies on the history, culture and language of China. What followed was a dynamic, two-decade career navigating the professional waves of Silicon Valley and East Asia. Especially influential was my decade-long residency in Shanghai, where I took on a number of rewarding projects mainly for architecture, design and environmental firms.</p>

                    <section>
                    <p>Now, my professional interests have evolved toward instructional design, learning technologies, and associated fields. I have a inherent passion for cross-cultural training, adaptive learning systems,  and the promotion of smart, sustainable design. Further reinforcing my commitment to education, I'm currently enrolled in a Masters of Science program in Learning Technologies and Design at the University of Missouri, Columbia, which I expect to complete in the Fall of 2024.</p>
