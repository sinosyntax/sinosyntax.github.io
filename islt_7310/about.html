        <p>Take a moment to learn a bit more about me, including my interests, career progression, and the experiences that continue to inspire me.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <p>Growing up in California's culturally diverse Bay Area, I was fortunate to be surrounded by a myriad of cultures and values. A budding interest in music and the humanities quickly grew, broadening my worldview and instilling in me a deep appreciation for arts education.
        </p>
            </section>
            <section>
        <p>This exposure sparked a lifelong passion for learning and led me to become the first of my family to attend college. My focus was on East Asian Studies, particularly China, guided by explorations into world literature and music. These studies served as a springboard for a dynamic, two-decade career that took me from Silicon Valley to Asia. My decade-long residency in Shanghai was particularly influential, where I leveraged my skills mainly in marketing and communications for architectural and environmental firms.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
        <p>Now, my professional interests have evolved towards instructional design and associated fields. I have a growing passion for cross-cultural training, innovative adaptive learning methodologies, and the promotion of sustainable design. Further reinforcing my commitment to education, I'm currently enrolled in a Masters of Science program in Learning Technologies and Design at the University of Missouri, Columbia, expected to culminate in December 2024.</p>
